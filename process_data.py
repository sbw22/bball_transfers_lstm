# Getting the data to work with missing time splits is a challenge. There are a few options to handle this:
# Option 1: Only train model on players with correct amount of time splits. 
# Option 2: Replace missing time splits with the average of the previous and next time split.
# Option 3: Use a more complex model that can handle missing data.


# Next Steps:
# 1. Transform complete player data into a format suitable for training.
# 1a. Create a function that finds the length of rise or fall from split to split for each player (like the stock market video). 
# 2. Save and export to model file.
